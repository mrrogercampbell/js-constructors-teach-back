# JS Constructors Teach-Back
This repo was created to assist in the facilitation of teaching interview where I will discuss JavaScript Constructor and walk students through two activities.

## Lesson Plans
I have created two Markdown lesson plans:
* [Instructor Lesson Plan](./instructorLessonPlan.md) - a plan I created to assist me running the class. Provides high level points to cover and defines an overall structure to the lesson.
* [Student Lesson Plan](./studentLessonPlan.md) - a student facing document which they are able to use a reference material during and after the lesson.

## Solution Code
I have also provided solution code to each activity:
* [Activity 1: rainingCatsAndDogs (Everyone Do)](./activityOneSolution.js)
* [Activity 2: rainingCatsAndDogs (Instructor Do)](./activityTwoSolution.js)
